Comp Sci Intro to Python Final Project
Difficulties:
- PLEASE READ: Hey so I had another final project due on the same night, so this was turned in a day late. The other project was for Calc II. I was in a group of 5 people. That being said, I did three pages (out of the seven that we needed to do) days ago. At 10 pm, as I was adding audio to my final project for this class, all of the group members collectively decided to start working on the essay. They messaged me asking for help, and decided to help them, hoping that it would take maybe five minutes. It did not, in fact, take five minutes. So, now I am here, turning in my comp sci project a day late, very upset about it, but still. That was my rant/explaination. Thanks. 
- I almost lost my mind trying to figure out what was wrong with my file. Turns out, I put the file in the wrong place. 
- Uploading this to Github was so frusterating. 
- I still don't know how to make the GUI red like I wanted it to be. 
Fun moments:
- Making the game and seeing it come to life was so fun. 
- I added my friend to the game- which was super cute!
- When I added music to the game it felt like it was a real, legit game and it was so nice.
