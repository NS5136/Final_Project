# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I'm choosing between:

The Overthinker
What If?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A choose your own adventure game about the daily life of a temple student. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This is a passion project for me. The goal is to have a full game with music, images, and a few endings. It will be executed using Ren'Py.
I want this to be a choose your own adventure- something like Doki Doki literature club. I want it to be a comedy game about a day in the life of a typical college student, but
I want it to tackle the small, lesser-known parts of living with anxiety- specifically how we overthink. I'm hoping to have 10 endings- the "true" ending would be just making it through the day.
The game itself is overdramatic on purpose. I want the "bad" endings to be intrusive thoughts that I have, so that's why it's going to be overdramatic. The game itself will probably be shorter-
maybe half an hour of gameplay. I want it to spread awareness on something that a lot of people struggle with, but in a lighthearted way. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be a game with images and 5 endings. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be a semi-completed game, images, 7 endings, and some music.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a full game, with music, images, and at least 10 endings. (not complicated endings)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to research the set-up of Ren'Py, as I have never used it before. I have most of the skills necessary for the project- I mostly need to learn how to work with a program that takes my
code and puts it into a playable game.
